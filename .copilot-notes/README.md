# Copilot Session Notes

This directory contains session notes to maintain context across GitHub Copilot chat sessions.

## How to Use

**At the start of a new chat session:**
- Ask me to "check the notes" or "what did we work on last time"
- I'll read the session notes and catch up on previous context

**During work:**
- I'll update session notes as we make progress
- Important decisions, code changes, and context will be documented

## Files

- `session-YYYY-MM-DD.md` - Individual session summaries
- Add any other project-specific notes as needed

## Note
These are markdown files created by Copilot to work around the fact that chat history isn't persisted. Feel free to edit them manually or ask me to update them.
