# Copilot Session Notes - January 6, 2026

## Session Summary
User discovered chat history is not persisted across VS Code sessions. Requested a workaround system to maintain context. Fixed failing JUnit tests in MyLinkedListTester.java for MOOC assignment.

## Solution Implemented
Created `.copilot-notes/` directory to store conversation summaries and important context across sessions.

## Project Context
- Working on MOOCTextEditor project (Java-based text editor with MOOC coursework)
- Module: Implementing and testing MyLinkedList (doubly-linked list)
- Repository: zawhtut/MOOCTextEditor on main branch

## Key Topics Discussed
1. Chat history persistence - explained it's not saved by default
2. Created this notes system as workaround
3. Git LFS issue - disabled by removing hooks
4. Fixed MyLinkedListTester.java failing tests

## Code Changes Made

### File: src/textgen/MyLinkedListTester.java

**Problem:** Grader tests #5 and #9 were failing due to incomplete boundary testing

**Test #5 Fix - testRemove():**
- Added test for `remove(-1)` throwing IndexOutOfBoundsException (lower bounds)
- Added test for `remove(size())` throwing IndexOutOfBoundsException (upper bounds)

**Test #9 Fix - testAddAtIndex():**
- Fully implemented the empty test method
- Added tests for adding at beginning, middle
- Added null element test (NullPointerException)
- Added test for `add(-1, element)` throwing IndexOutOfBoundsException (lower bounds)
- Added test for `add(size()+1, element)` throwing IndexOutOfBoundsException (upper bounds) ← Fixed #9

**Additional Implementation - testAddEnd():**
- Tests adding to empty list
- Tests adding to existing list
- Tests null element rejection (NullPointerException)

**Additional Implementation - testSize():**
- Tests size of empty, short, and long lists
- Tests size after add operations
- Tests size after remove operations

**Additional Implementation - testSet():**
- Tests setting elements and verifying return values
- Tests null element rejection (NullPointerException)
- Tests lower bounds: `set(-1, element)`
- Tests upper bounds: `set(size(), element)`

### Git Configuration Changes

**Disabled Git LFS:**
- Removed `.git/hooks/post-checkout`
- Removed `.git/hooks/post-commit`
- Removed `.git/hooks/post-merge`
- Reason: git-lfs not installed in dev container, hooks were failing

## Packages/Libraries

**None installed** - JUnit not available locally for compilation, but tests will run on grader platform which has JUnit configured.

## Test Results

**MyLinkedList.java (via grader):**
- All 20 tests PASSED ✓

**MyLinkedListTester.java (via grader - before fixes):**
- Test #5: FAILED - Missing lower bounds test on remove
- Test #9: FAILED - Missing upper bounds test on add

**MyLinkedListTester.java (via grader - after fixes):**
- Expected: All tests should now PASS

## Important Decisions

1. **Only fix bugs, don't change structure**: User emphasized not to modify imports, comments, or @author tags - only fix the specific issues
2. **Ask before running commands**: Provide description of what command does, but don't need permission for every tool call
3. **Test thoroughness matters**: Grader evaluates not just implementation correctness but also test completeness, especially boundary conditions

## Action Items
- Submit updated MyLinkedListTester.java to grader platform
- Verify all tests pass

---
**Instructions for future sessions:**
- Read this file and other session notes at start of new conversations
- Update this or create new session notes as work progresses
- Keep notes concise but include key context, decisions, and code changes
